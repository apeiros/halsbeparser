Since I'm probably using non-standard terminology, so let me explain what means
what:

Parse-Expression: An expression that tells the parser how to proceed with
                  parsing. Can be a regex, a boolean expression with nodes,
                  transients, terminals and tokens or any other piece of code
Node:             Anything that ends up in the AST.
Terminal:         A node that has no child-nodes in the AST. Or in other words,
                  whose parse-expression is only a regex or consists only of
                  tokens.
Token:            A parse-expression that is not composed by further parse-
                  expressions. Usually a regex.
Transient:        A parse-expression that does not end up in the AST itself.
                  Usually used to branch out several possibilities and aid with
                  more understandable naming.
